# Next.js 15 Client-Side Navigation Error: Failed Module Import

This repository demonstrates a runtime error in a Next.js 15 application that occurs during client-side navigation. The error stems from a failed module import within a dynamically loaded component.

## Bug Description

The `pages/about.js` component attempts to import a module (`./nonExistentModule`) that does not exist.  This results in a runtime error when navigating to the `/about` route on the client-side. The error prevents the rest of the component from rendering.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the `/about` page. Observe the error in the browser's console.

## Solution

The solution involves removing the failed import statement, ensuring that all modules being imported actually exist within the project.
